    "# Intro to Data Science With scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're going to walk through running a model, and looking at the results. Before we get started let's go over some terminology...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) `features` - Another word for the X variables, independent variables, predictors, regressors...   \n",
    "2.) `target` - Another word for the Y variable, dependent variable, outcome variable, response...  \n",
    "3.) `model` - What we use to relate one set of variables to another.      \n",
    "4.) `training data set` - Refers to the observations from your data set that are used to train/learn the statistical model.   \n",
    "5.) `testing data set` - Refers to the observations from your data that are **not** used to train/learn the statistical model. They are held out, and not seen by the model during training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit-learn import\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sklearn \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we're actually going to be importing something from one of the modules/libraries in `sklearn`. The [sklearn main page](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) can help you determine where you might find something that you are looking for, and the [API reference](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes) is also pretty helpful. A large majority of all of the machine learning algorithms you might run can be found somewhere within `sklearn`. Today we're going to talk through using a `Random Forest Regressor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps by which we train a model... \n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Import whatever model you'll be fitting.  \n",
    "2.) Instantiate the model (i.e. create a variable that holds your model object). Set any hyperparameters as you see fit (we'll discuss what these are shortly).   \n",
    "3.) Feed in the X and Y variables (features and target) to the `.fit()` method.   \n",
    "4.) Call the `.score()` or `.predict()` method to see how well the model does on the training data (or new data). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What would be another word/term we might use to describe the `new data` from step (4) above?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with a `RandomForestRegressor` tonight, which you can see the documentation for [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html). I don't have time today to discuss in detail how the algorithm works, but I will if you take the data science course or ask me after class. It's well explained in the Elements of Statistical Learning, which you can download [here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)."

    "So, we have run two models now, and saw that the second one performed better. We could keep adding variables into our model, checking the MSE after adding in any variable. But we're not actually running our model on any data that we aren't training it on, so how do we know that what we are putting into our model would actually help on data that we've never seen. In other words, how do we tell if our model will generalize well? The answer is **cross validation**.\n",

We take those predictions, and then get our scoring metric (`mean squared error`, in our case) using those predictions. We then do this again, and again, and again, until each of the `k` folds has been used for predictions (so with 5 folds, we do this 5 times, and with 10 folds, 10 times, etc.)\n",

Check out the [cross validation library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes#module-sklearn.cross_validation) for all the details. Today we'll be looking at the `cross_val_score` function, which allows you to pass in a model, a target (Y), a feature set (X), a number of folds (5 or 10, for example), and a scoring function (we'll use our mean_squared_error).

We have to make sure that our model will generalize well, and cross-validation is a way to make sure that we are putting the right variables into our model. It can also be used to check our model hyperparameters (for a random forest, this might be the number of trees, the depth of each tree, etc.). `Sklearn` also has a built in to perform cross-validation over hyperparameters. It is located in the `sklearn.grid_search` module, and it is called `GridSearchCV`. As arguments, it takes an estimator/model (such as our Random Forest) and a parameter grid (dictionary). We instantiate it with these, and then we call the `.fit()` method on it, passing it our features and target. It returns back to us the best parameters to use for our model. "

    "So there's actually not that much of a difference between the performance of the best model, whether or not we include \"wind\" as a feature. In general (to avoid the risk of overfitting), simpler models should always be used unless the MSE improves significantly by adding additional features. In this case, adding \"wind\" actually makes the MSE go up, so it's clear we shouldn stick with the model that only uses geographical coordinates.\n",

    "1.) Import whatever model you'll be fitting.  \n",
    "2.) Instantiate the model (i.e. create a variable that holds your model object). Set any hyperparameters as you see fit.   \n",
    "3.) Feed in the X and Y variables (features and target) to the `.fit()` method.   \n",
    "4.) Call the `.score()` or `.predict()` method to see how well the model does on the training data (or new data).   \n",
    "5.) Repeat steps (2) - (4) to find the best model given your chosen scoring metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This assumes that all of your feature engineering/variable manipulation is done. Also note that the random forest is unique among machine learning models in that you don't have to cross-validate to test it (you can use out-of-box score instead), which is nice because cross-validation is computationally expensive and requires you to holdout data that could have been used to train the model. This is a discussion for another day though."
